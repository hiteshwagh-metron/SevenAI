# Jira Integration with React and Go

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to integrate a React frontend with a Go backend for Jira using OAuth2. The React app handles user authentication, while the Go backend manages OAuth2 token exchange, data ingestion, and federated search functionality.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm
- Go
- Access to Jira API credentials

## Setup

### Step 1: Set Up the React App

1. Create the React app:

   ```sh
   npx create-react-app jira-connect-app

2. Setup Golang Project

    ```sh
    mkdir jira-go-connector
    cd jira-go-connector
    go mod init jira-go-connector

## Workflow Overview

### React App

#### User Interface

- **"Connect to Jira" Button:** Provides a UI element to initiate the OAuth2 authorization flow.

#### OAuth2 Authorization Flow

- **Button Click:** When the user clicks the button, it redirects them to Jira's OAuth2 authorization page.
- **Redirect URI:** After successful authentication, Jira redirects the user back to your application with an authorization code.

### OAuth2 Authorization

#### Redirect to Jira

- **Authorization URL:** The user is redirected to Jira's authorization URL with the necessary parameters (client ID, redirect URI, scope).

#### Callback Handling

- **Authorization Code:** After authentication, Jira redirects to your application's callback URL with an authorization code.

### Golang Backend

#### Handle OAuth2 Callback

- **Exchange Code for Token:** The backend receives the authorization code and exchanges it for an access token using Jira's token endpoint.
- **Save Token:** The backend saves the token for future use.

#### Data Ingest

- **Fetch Data:** Use the access token to fetch data from Jira via its APIs.
- **Data Processing:** Implement functionality to pull and ingest the data as required.

#### Federated Search

- **Search Data:** Implement functionality to search through the ingested data based on specific criteria.
